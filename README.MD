<h3>Hum challenge app</h3>

Use `QuestionnaireFactory` to create new instance of `QuestionnaireManager` and start working process.<br>
As an argument `getManager` method uses implementation of `ExternalService` interface. In tests I used special mocked class,
that implements logic from the task.

<h2>Optional part</h2>
Optional part is located in `LambdaUtils` class and also covered with simple tests.
